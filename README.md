# GUIDE-TO-OpenCV-Cv2


I used OpenCV to work with images of NUSTâ€™s Central Library and Main Office and explored several image processing techniques. 

> **1. Image Basics & Editing:**
- Opened, displayed, and saved images to start working with them.
- Resized, cropped, rotated, stacked, and combined images to create new views.
- Flipped images and changed between BGR, RGB, and Grayscale formats.

> **2. Object Detection & Drawing:**
- Detected objects in the images to highlight important parts.
- Added shapes and text to make the images more informative and interesting.

> **3. Edge Detection & Sharpening:**
- Used Canny edge detection to find and enhance the edges in the images.

OpenCV helped me learn and create different ways to work with images.
